# StupidChess
A work-in-progress set of chess engines that play chess really badly really well. The idea is inspired by ["30 Weird Chess Algorithms: Elo World"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpXy041BIlA) and the technical inspiration comes from the [GoBit](https://github.com/carokanns/GoBit) engine, which is written as part of a YouTube series [Writing a Chess Engine in Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fIbI3xXLA4&list=PLftcy-r3mehgu4gikLTFoI1CXh2bHm3rf).
